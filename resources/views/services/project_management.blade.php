            <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; color: green">Project managers play a key role in ensuring that each project is successfully completed. Effective project managers couple proven processes with the ability to manage and interact with people. Our project managers bring a skill set that includes:</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Plan Development</h3>

            <p>Planning is one of the most important processes of a project, as many projects fail due to poor planning. Projects are naturally unpredictable, there is no one size fit all approach. Our project managers will create a clear and concise plan to both execute and monitor its progress.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Time Management</h3>

            <p>One of the biggest constraints on a project can come in the form of time. Given that deadlines are non-negotiable it is important for a project manager to know how to effectively;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Define activities</li>
              <li>Sequence activities</li>
              <li>Estimate activity durations</li>
              <li>Develop a schedule</li>
              <li>Maintain a schedule</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h3>Controlling Cost</h3>

            <p>Cost is one of the biggest key performance indicators for a project, our project managers monitor the earned value closely to ensure that the proper corrective action is taken if necessary to ensure a project stays within budget.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Controlling Risk</h3>

            <p>There are unknown variables that may factor into any project. It is the project managerâ€™s role to anticipate and prepare for this. Not all risks can be completely avoided; therefore, the project manager must implement the proper risk response plan to either accept, avoid, transfer or mitigate the risk.</p>
